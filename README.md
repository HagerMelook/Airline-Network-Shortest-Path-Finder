# Airline-Network-Shortest-Path-Finder

Problem Statement: - 

Imagine you are tasked with developing a tool to assist airline passengers in finding 
the most efficient route between two airports within the airline's network. Create a 
Java program that models an airline network as a graph, where airports are nodes 
and flights are edges. Your program should enable users to input details of the flight 
connections between airports and find the shortest path between a specified source 
and destination airport. 

• Implement a class to represent the airline network graph. Each airport is a 
node, and flights between airports are edges. You can choose an adjacency 
matrix or adjacency list to represent the graph. 

• Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two specified 
airports in the airline network. 

• Display the optimal route details, including the sequence of airports to visit 
and the total distance or time required for the journey. 

• Implement error handling mechanisms to handle cases where the specified 
source or destination airport is not in the network or when there is no direct 
flight between them.
